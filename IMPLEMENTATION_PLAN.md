## Approach
1. Analyze the requirements
2. Identify files to modify
3. Implement changes
4. Run tests and linting
5. Commit and push

## Files to Touch
- To be determined during implementation

## Commands to Run


## Expected Outcomes
- Task requirements are met
- All tests pass
- Code follows project conventions

## Risks/Assumptions
- Assuming clean codebase state
- Assuming tests are comprehensive

## Error
AI execution failed: Canceled

Please implement the changes manually following the plan above.
